        The first written evidence of the official Games dates from 776 BC, when
        the Greeks began measuring time in Olympiads, or the duration between
        each edition of the Olympic Games.&nbsp;<span
          >The first Olympic Games were held every four years in honour of the
          god Zeus. From then on, a number of artistic activities such as music,
          singing, poetry and theatre were organised at the Pythian or Delphic
          Games (a separate event to the Games held in Olympia), linking culture
          and sport right from the beginning of the Games.</span

        In 393 AD, the Roman Emperor Theodosius I banned the Olympic Games for
        religious reasons, claiming that they encouraged paganism. They were not
        revived until the modern era.

        A number of initiatives to re-establish an international sporting event
        were attempted at the end of the 19th century, but failed due to the
        lack of coordination among the worldwide sporting movement â€“ until one
        man decided to bring the main stakeholders together in Paris.&nbsp;
