    <p>Women have been programming since before it was a thing. Take <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace">Ada Lovelace</a>: Daughter of Lord Byron, she's often credited as the first computer programmer. Her work on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_Engine">Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine</a> contains notes of the first machine-implemented algorithm.</p>

Despite their groundbreaking work, the Army never released the names of the women who worked on the ENIAC, and they were largely forgotten until Kathy Kleiman discovered their story in 1985.<br></p><video controls=""

    <p>In her career with the Navy, Rear Admiral Grace Hopper worked on the first commercial computer (UNIVAC) and laid the groundwork for the programming language COBOL. But her most notable invention was the compiler, which can transform a source language into binary code. (In other words, it can translate the code you and I write into Os and 1s.) She developed it in 1952, but she said "Nobody would touch it. They told me computers could only do arithmetic."</p>

In 1956, she worked with NASA and IBM on Project Mercury, the first manned space flight. She worked with NASA again a few years later on the Apollo Project.</p>
