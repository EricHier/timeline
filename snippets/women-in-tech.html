        Code named "Project PX" and funded by the United States Army, the first
        general-purpose computer was the Electronic Numerical Integrator And
        Computer (ENIAC). It was developed at the University of Pennsylvania's
        Moore School of Electrical Engineering.<audio>

        The ENIAC programmers included a number of women: Jean Bartik, Marlyn
        Wescoff Meltzer, Ruth Lichterman Teitelbaum, Kay McNulty Mauchly
        Antonelli, Frances Spence, and Frances Elizabeth "Betty" Holberton.
        Despite their groundbreaking work, the Army never released the names of
        the women who worked on the ENIAC, and they were largely forgotten until
        Kathy Kleiman discovered their story in 1985.

        Hungarian-born Rózsa Péter studied number theory and poetry before
        becoming interested in the idea that would become recursion theory. She
        published her paper "Recursive Functions" in 1951, but it wasn't until
        the mid-50's that she began to apply her work to the realm of computers.

      <p>
        In her career with the Navy, Rear Admiral Grace Hopper worked on the
        first commercial computer (UNIVAC) and laid the groundwork for the
        programming language COBOL. But her most notable invention was the
        compiler, which can transform a source language into binary code. (In
        other words, it can translate the code you and I write into 0s and 1s.)
        She developed it in 1952, but she said "Nobody would touch it. They told
        me computers could only do arithmetic."<audio>

        One of the first African-American women to earn a Ph.D in mathematics,
        Evelyn Boyd Granville focused on aeronautics and space during her
        career. In 1956, she worked with NASA and IBM on Project Mercury, the
        first manned space flight. She worked with NASA again a few years later
        on the Apollo Project.

        One of the first women (if not the first woman) to earn a Ph.D in
        computer science, Sister Mary Kenneth Keller also contributed to the
        development of the BASIC language during her time at Dartmouth College.
        She then founded the computer science department at Clarke College and
        directed it for the next 20 years.<audio>

        A professor at Cambridge Computer Laboratory, Spärck Jones was
        interested in natural language processing and information retrieval. In
        1972, she introduced the concept of inverse document frequency, which
        most search engines still rely on.

        Often called "the Mother of the Internet," Radia Perlman's work on
        spanning tree protocol enabled the development of modern networking. She
        holds more than 100 patents, which is what mothers do best.
